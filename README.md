<h1 align="center">The Block Button</h1>

<p align="center">
  Have you ever received that <em>one</em> trade where clicking the 'Decline' button just isn't enough?
</p>
<p align="center">
  Say hello to the <strong>Block Button</strong>! ðŸš«
</p>
<p align="center">
  The Block Button adds a 'Block' button right next to the 'Decline' button, letting you quickly take action when you receive one of <em>those</em> trades.

## How to install:
Upon downloading and extracting the folder, go to your browser extensions manager (chrome://extensions/ for Google Chrome). Depending on your browser, you may need to enable certain settings like Developer mode on Chrome, after which you can click "Load unpacked" and select the project folder to import the extension to your browser.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> The Block Button uses your .ROBLOSECURITY cookie to make the appropriate API requests (block & decline trade). Your cookies are not logged, and all project files can be freely inspected to verify this.
